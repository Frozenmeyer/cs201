\section{Design}

Getting each of the individual applications was easy. I already had Github, Visual Studio and VS code were easy to get. Getting all of these applications to play together was a nightmare and I'm uncertain I've  done it correctly even now.

\section{Post Mortem}

A lot went wrong for quite a while. Linking and learning how these different applications work is realistically still a work in progress. I think I've cobbled together enough work arounds to submit and test code

\section{Answers to Questions}

In this section, you will write the answers to the questions in the homework assignment.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Software can be very versatile problem solving. Trained neural networks can be used for all sorts of pattern recognition specifically early detection of cancerous cells.\ldots
    \item Anyone can be a software developer, but most of the time they are pragmatic and probably tired. If you're between jobs you'll likely wear a suit, otherwise a T-shirt. \ldots
    \item Ram: 4 GB, Disk: 256 GB, Main Memory: ??\ldots
    \item #1 Video Games, #2 Eventually Artificial Intelligence, #3 Movies and other streaming, #4 Software developement, #5 Web developement. I'm most interested in Software / Webdevelopement as a career, but I love working on games so that may be a side project of mine. Additionally AI developements will be very interesting to follow up on and have personal knowledge of, although I doubt I'll be of much use in the field.\ldots
\end{enumerate}
